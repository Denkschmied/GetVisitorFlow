# GetVisitorFlow
The repository contains a object recognition software for detecting pedestrians, bicycles, and cars. Beside detection, the software counts the movement of the objects distinguishing the direction (left to right, right to left). The software was developed in the course of the project [DIH-West](https://dih-west.at/) together with students from the [Kufstein University of Applied Science](https://www.fh-kufstein.ac.at/) in the Master study progra [Smart Products & Solutions](https://www.fh-kufstein.ac.at/studieren/master/smart-products-solutions-bb).
